# AwesomeArchLinux
A collection of my shell scripts with hardened Arch Linux configuration, security tweaks and more.
The idea is to make this repo a reliable and curated reference to Arch Linux hardened installations, hardening set ups, and configurations.

To run the base scripts on your machine, all you need to do is:

1. Have both **archinstall.sh** and **chroot.sh** on the same directory.
2. Edit the variables on both files: your target device, username...
3. chmod +x **archinstall.sh** and **chroot.sh**
4. Then run **archinstall.sh** like so: ./archinstall.sh
